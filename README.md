# Amazon Clone WebApp

An Amazon clone E-commerce site built entirely with React & React context for state management. User authentication is done using firebase and a registered user is recognized across the website. Items can be added or removed dynamically from the basket. The total price of the items in the basket is also dynamically calculated each time an item is added or removed.
